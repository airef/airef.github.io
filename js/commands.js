Usually the AI favors building lumber camps near forests rather than straggler trees, but the AI will build lumber camps near straggler trees if sn-lumber-camp-max-distance is to small for the AI to find an available forest to build the lumber camp by.</p><p><strong>Docks</strong> are of course only placed on water, and there are several SNs that can affect their placement, such as " + snDockAvoidanceFactor.getLink() + ", " + snDockPlacementMode.getLink() + ", " + snDockProximityFactor.getLink() + ", and " + snMinimumWaterBodySizeForDock.getLink() + ".</p><p><strong>Farms</strong> are automatically placed near town centers, mills, and folwarks.

Instead, they should only be placed with up-build-line. It's possible they can be placed with the build command, but they often won't be placed in the right location. Also, make sure to use (up-assign-builders c: fish-trap c: -1) to make sure that villagers aren't sent to contruct them.</p><p><strong>Outposts</strong>, at least according to this <a href=\"https://airef.github.io/resources/articles/helpful-info.html#building-construction-distances\">info</a>, are placed outside the town, at a distance between sn-maximum-town-size and twice the distance of sn-maximum-town-size.

You can build them in more precise locations or inside the town if you use the place-control or place-point options with up-build, or you can also place them with up-build-line.</p><p><strong>Towers</strong> are the only type of building that uses sn-minimum-town-size as the minimum distance they can be placed from the starting town center.

These bank accounts are restricted to holding between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 dollars, and they all start with -$1 (negative 1 dollars) stored inside them until they are used by a customer (the AI scripter). The " + cSetGoal.getLink() + " and " + cUpModifyGoal.getLink() + " commands can modify how much money is stored in a particular account.</p><p>Following this bank metaphor, the " + cGoal.getLink() + " command checks if the given bank account number holds the given amount of money. For example, (goal 5 13) checks if goal ID #5 holds the value 13 (i.e. bank account #5 holds $13), and (goal 415 -3274) checks if goal ID #415 holds the value -3,274 (i.e. bank account #415 holds -$3,274). You can also use " + cUpCompareGoal.getLink() + " to check the current value of a goal ID in a more powerful manner, such as checking if the goal stores greater or less than the given value.</p><p>It is pretty common to use a defconst to refer to a goal ID number to make the AI more readable.

cSetGoal.description = "Sets a given goal to a given value. While their purpose may be unclear based on their name, goals are variables which can store an integer value which can be checked with this command or with " + cUpCompareGoal.getLink() + ". Each goal is given an ID, and AIs have 512 goals available that they can use to store different values, and they all store the value -1 at the beginning of the game. Goals are one of the most important concepts of AI scripting, so it's good to learn how to use them.</p><p>In programming speak, goals are a 512-length one-indexed 32-bit integer array, pre-initialized to -1, and a GoalId refers to a particular index of that array. The set-goal command sets the value the given GoalId to the given integer value. New goals or variables cannot be defined, only constants (called defconsts by the AI engine), so AI scripters are limited to these 512 goals, though unused strategic numbers can also be used like goals in a pinch.</p><p>If the paragraph above makes absolutely no sense to you, you can imagine goals like a bank which holds 512 bank accounts, numbered with IDs from 1 to 512. These accounts can hold whole amounts (no cents or decimal amounts of money), and they can store either positive or negative amounts of money. These bank accounts are restricted to holding between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 dollars, and they all start with -$1 (negative 1 dollars) stored inside them until they are used by a customer (the AI scripter). The set-goal and " + cUpModifyGoal.getLink() + " commands can modify how much money is stored in a particular account.</p><p>Following this bank metaphor, the " + cGoal.getLink() + " command checks if the given bank account number holds the given amount of money. For example, (goal 5 13) checks if goal ID #5 holds the value 13 (i.e. bank account #5 holds $13), and (goal 415 -3274) checks if goal ID #415 holds the value -3,274 (i.e. bank account #415 holds -$3,274). You can also use " + cUpCompareGoal.getLink() + " to check the current value of a goal ID in a more powerful manner, such as checking if the goal stores greater or less than the given value.</p><p>It is pretty common to use a defconst to refer to a goal ID number to make the AI more readable.

cXsScriptCall.shortDescription = "DE only. Call an XS script function from an .xs file.";
cXsScriptCall.description = "DE only. Call an XS script function from an .xs file. It is not necessary to defconst the function name. If the function name is misspelled or a function with that name doesn't exist in any included .xs files, the command will do nothing, without reporting an error.</p><p>For more info on XS scripting, see this exhaustive guide: <a href=\"https://ugc.aoe2.rocks/general/xs/beginner/\">link</a>.</p><p>The function must be from a .xs file that has been \"included\" (loaded) by the AI script. To include a .xs file in an AI script, use the include command, like (include \"Example XS File.xs\"). Note that the filetype (.xs) must be included in the include command, and the filepath must be inside quotes. By default, .xs files must be placed in the game's xs folder, located at: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\AoE2DE\\resources\\_common\\xs\", but you can also load .xs files with a relative filepath name, using \"..\" to go up a filepath level from the xs folder and then follow the rest of the filepath to get to your .xs file. For example, to include a .xs file stored in your \"My AI\" folder within the default AI installation directory, you can use (include \"../ai/My AI/Example XS File.xs\").</p><p>Once you have included your .xs file, you can use xs-script-call to call any function from that file that doesn't have any parameters. So, if you have the code below in your XS file, you can call the helloWorld() function, but not the max() function.</p><p>xs-script-call can be used as either a Fact or an Action, and it'll execute the function either way. However, if used as a Fact, xs-script-call will be a Fact that is considered false if your function returns 0, returns \"false\", or is a void function that doesn't return anything. Because of this, if you want to use xs-script-call successfully anywhere in a rule, it's a good idea to make this function a bool function that returns \"true\" or an int function that returns any non-zero value. The AI can't do anything with the value that is returned from this function, but the xs-script-call Fact itself will return true.</p><p>If you do need an AI to be able use an integer result from an XS function, you can use the xsSetGoal() or xsSetStrategicNumber() functions within an XS function to modify the value of a goal or SN, which the AI script can then check. Likewise, xsGetGoal() and xsGetStrategicNumber() functions can allow an XS function to get the current value of a goal or SN.</p><p>If you call an XS function more than once, it's a good idea to defconst it (see the examples below). Otherwise, each time you call the function in the AI script it will add an entry to the string table.</p><p>Here is some example .xs code which is used in the examples section below:</p><div class=\"example\"><p>//This code is saved in a file called Example XS File.xs<br><br>float max(float a = 0.0, float b = 2.0) {<br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">if(a > b)</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">return (a);</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">else</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">return (b);</span><br>}<br><br>bool helloWorld() {<br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">xsChatData(\"Hello World\");</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">return (true);</span><br>}<br><br>int rand() {<br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">int rand = xsGetRandomNumber(); //generates a random number between 0 and 32766</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">rand++; //increase random number range to between 1 and 32767 so that zero isn't returned, making a xs-script-call condition false</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">xsSetGoal(510, rand);</span><br><span style=\"margin-left: 10px;\">return (rand);</span><br>}</p></div>";

There can be many houses and wall segments (each one counts as a separate \"building\") on a map each game, so ES moved these objects into a separate [inactive] list that does not update per-turn to avoid excessive computational overhead.

The gather point was later cleared when we call up-gather-inside with state=0. But something is not working in the new patch. The newly created vills always get garrisoned. Even if I manually change the gather point with DUC the new vills continue to gather inside for a second. Seems like a bug.

You still cannot use action-ungarrison at all (the one that works on individual units).</p><p>Update: So it turns out that I did not test (up-gather-inside c: building c: -1) properly. There are actually 3 bugs with this command: (1) You can not properly set the gather point since it seems to just get reset each loop. You can only set it in the same loop that you use the unload command. (2) While you can now use action-unload and go-to-work on the tc the villagers won't actually gather from the resource that you used the gather point on. Instead they just walk up to it, bump into it, and then reassign elsewhere. (3) THE BIG ONE: you still cannot use action-ungarrison at all (the one that works on individual units). Ideally this command would just stop the AI automatic ungarrison of buildings - effectively making it equivalent to human buildings. I want control of when my units garrison/ungarrison and I cannot do that when the game is constantly interfering. On UP it appears that this command is implemented by setting the gather point onto the building itself. IMO this is really a hacky solution since whenever you set the gather point manually the units will all ungarrison unless you instantly set it back to the building afterwards. Sadly, there is nothing we can do to change it now although it can be worked around (as I have done). I am not sure how it is implemented on DE but it seems like it may be resetting the gather point back to the building each loop. If this is the case then the first thing to change would by to only set it once (otherwise there is no method to control ungarrison without the game interfering). But ideally DE would just implement the human behaviour I described above."

[See attached AI file at Discord link] Update: I looks like the up-build escrow bug is fixed, at least mostly. Using an escrow goal set to with-escrow, like (up-build place-normal gl-escrow c: house) allows the AI to build a house as long as it has 25 wood, regardless of the amount of wood in escrow, which is great. The only issue is that the amount of escrow wood doesn't seem to decrease when all the AI's wood is in escrow. I set the wood escrow to 100 and had the AI build as many houses as possible. Even when the AI had 0 total wood left, the amount of wood escrow stayed at 100, at least according to up-get-fact. Update 2: It looks like the EscrowGoalId for up-build simply is not used by the engine. Any GoalId number (0, 1, or 501) will allow the AI to construct the building, but escrow amounts remain unchanged."

Alian713 gave a good hint: If the scenario is a 2p map and you change to a colour thats not 1 or 2 you're adding another player to it which wasn't on the map itself the colour actually changes which player you become in the scenario its not just colour itself pt2 of me asking for colour picker to be separated in the lobby from the 1-8 player numbers.
